# User Authentication System
This project is a simple User Authentication System built in C++ using file handling. It allows users to sign up, log in, and reset their passwords. The program presents a menu with options to Login, Sign Up, Forgot Password, or Exit. User data is stored in a file (Login.txt) in the format: Username Email Password. During login, the program checks the file for matching credentials. If a user forgets their password, they can verify their username and email to retrieve it or reset it. The program reads and writes user credentials to Login.txt, and a temporary file (temp.txt) is used for password updates. It requires a C++ compiler (g++ recommended) and basic knowledge of C++. Possible improvements include encrypting passwords for better security, using a database instead of a text file, adding a graphical user interface (GUI), and implementing email verification.
